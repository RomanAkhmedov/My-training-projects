**_1. Football Statistic_**

The presented database contains statistics of the top 5 European football championships (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France).

There is information about players (date of birth, cost, position, nationality), football clubs (sponsors, trophies won, home stadiums),
stadiums (capacity, average attendance).

With the help of sample scripts, you can track dependencies and create ratings for the parameters of interest
(as examples: the most visited championship, depending on the percentage of stadium occupancy; the most expensive football clubs,
depending on the total cost of the players playing in these clubs, etc.).
